abstract = {In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach to create the mapping between gesture and sound in interactive music systems. Specifically, we propose to use a multimodal HMM to conjointly model the gesture and sound parameters. Our approach is compatible with a learning method that allows users to define the gesture--sound relationships interactively. We describe an implementation of this method for the control of physical modeling sound synthesis. Our model is promising to capture expressive gesture variations while guaranteeing a consistent relationship between gesture and sound.},

abstract = {High dynamic range imaging (HDRI) methods in computational photography address situations where the dynamic range of a scene exceeds what can be captured by an image sensor in a single exposure. HDRI techniques have also been used to construct radiance maps in measurement applications, but unfortunately the design and evaluation of HDRI algorithms for use in these applications have received little attention. In this paper, we develop a novel HDRI technique based upon pixelby- pixel Kalman filtering and evaluate its performance using objective metrics that this paper also introduces. In the presented experiments, this new technique achieves as much as a 9.4 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio, and can achieve as much as a 29\% improvement in radiometric accuracy over a classic method.},

abstract = {We have reported activities in audiovisual speech processing, with emphasis on lip reading and lip synchronization. These research results have shown that, with lip reading, it is possible to enhance the reliability of audio speech recognition, which may result in a computer that can truly understand the user via hand-free natural spoken language even in a very noisy environments. Similarly, with lip synchronization, it is possible to render realistic talking heads with lip movements synchronized with the voice, which is very useful for human-computer interactions. We envision that in the near future, advancement in audiovisual speech processing will greatly increase the usability of computers. Once that happens, the cameras and the microphone may replace the keyboard and the mouse as better mechanisms for human-computer interaction},

@inproceedings{Ye2009,
abstract = {Classification of time series has been attracting great interest over the past decade. Recent empirical evidence has strongly suggested that the simple nearest neighbor algorithm is very difficult to beat for most time series problems.While this may be considered good news, given the simplicity of implementing the nearest neighbor algorithm, there are some negative consequences of this. First, the nearest neighbor algorithm requires storing and searching the entire dataset, resulting in a time and space complexity that limits its applicability, especially on resource-limited sensors. Second, beyond mere classification accuracy, we often wish to gain some insight into the data. In this work we introduce a new time series primitive, time series shapelets, which addresses these limitations. Informally, shapelets are time series subsequences which are in some sense maximally representative of a class. As we shall show with extensive empirical evaluations in diverse domains, algorithms based on the time series shapelet primitives can be interpretable, more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art classifiers.},

@article{Peretz2005,
abstract = {Research on how the brain processes music is emerging as a rich and stimulating area of investigation of perception, memory, emotion, and performance. Results emanating from both lesion studies and neuroimaging techniques are reviewed and integrated for each of these musical functions. We focus our attention on the common core of musical abilities shared by musicians and nonmusicians alike. Hence, the effect of musical training on brain plasticity is examined in a separate section, after a review of the available data regarding music playing and reading skills that are typically cultivated by musicians. Finally, we address a currently debated issue regarding the putative existence of music-specific neural networks. Unfortunately, due to scarcity of research on the macrostructure of music organization and on cultural differences, the musical material under focus is at the level of the musical phrase, as typically used in Western popular music.},

abstract = {In robotics research is an increasing need for knowledge about human motions. However humans tend to perceive motion in terms of discrete motion primitives. Most systems use data-driven mo- tion segmentation to retrieve motion primitives. Besides that the actual intention and context of the motion is not taken into account. In our work we propose a procedure for segmenting motions according to their functional goals, which allows a structuring and modeling of functional motion primitives1. The manual procedure is the first step towards an automatic functional motion representation. This procedure is useful for applications such as imitation learning and human motion recognition. We applied the proposed procedure on several motion sequences and built a motion recognition system based on manually segmented motion capture data. We got a motion primitive error rate of 0.9 \% for the marker-based recognition. Consequently the proposed procedure yields motion primitives that are suitable for human motion recognition.},

We report on a study where an existing musical work was used to provide a gesture vocabulary. The biophysical sensing already used in the work was used as input modality, and augmented with several other input sensing modalities not in the original piece. The bioacoustics-based sensor, accelerometer sensors, and full-body motion capture system generated data recorded into a multimodal database. We plotted the data from the different modalities and offer observations based on visual analysis of the collected data. Our preliminary results show that there is complementarity of different forms in the information. We noted three types of complementarity: synchronicity,},

abstract = {The control of musical instrument physical models is dif- ficult; it takes many years for professional musicians to learn their craft. We perform intelligent control of a violin physical model by analyzing the audio output and adjust- ing the physical inputs to the system using trained Support Vector Machines (SVM). Vivi, the virtual violinist is a computer program which can perform music notation with the same skill as a beginning violin student. After only four hours of interactive training, Vivi can play all of Suzuki violin volume 1 with quality that is comparable to a human student. Although physical constants are used to generate audio with the model, the control loop takes a “black-box” ap- proach to the system. The controller generates the finger position, bow-bridge distance, bow velocity, and bow force without knowing those physical constants. This method can therefore be used with other bowed-string physical mod- els and even musical robots.},

While most researchers currently utilize an iterative approach to refining classifier models and performance, we propose that ensemble classification techniques may be a viable and even preferable alternative. In ensemble learning, algorithms combine multiple classifiers to build one that is superior to its components. In this paper, we present EnsembleMatrix, an interactive visualization system that presents a graphical view of confusion matrices to help users understand relative merits of various classifiers. EnsembleMatrix allows users to directly interact with the visualizations in order to explore and build combination models. We evaluate the efficacy of the system and the approach in a user study. Results show that users are able to quickly combine multiple classifiers operating on multiple feature sets to produce an ensemble classifier with accuracy that approaches best-reported performance classifying images in the CalTech-101 dataset.},

@article{Pavlovic1997,
abstract = {The use of hand gestures provides an attractive alternative to cumbersome interface devices for human-computer interaction (HCI). In particular, visual interpretation of hand gestures can help in achieving the ease and naturalness desired for HCI. This has motivated a very active research area concerned with computer vision-based analysis and interpretation of hand gestures. We survey the literature on visual interpretation of hand gestures in the context of its role in HCI. This discussion is organized on the basis of the method used for modeling, analyzing, and recognizing gestures. Important differences in the gesture interpretation approaches arise depending on whether a 3D model of the human hand or an image appearance model of the human hand is used. 3D hand models offer a way of more elaborate modeling of hand gestures but lead to computational hurdles that have not been overcome given the real-time requirements of HCI. Appearance-based models lead to computationally efficient \&amp;ldquo;purposive\&amp;rdquo; approaches that work well under constrained situations but seem to lack the generality desirable for HCI. We also discuss implemented gestural systems as well as other potential applications of vision-based gesture recognition. Although the current progress is encouraging, further theoretical as well as computational advances are needed before gestures can be widely used for HCI. We discuss directions of future research in gesture recognition, including its integration with other natural modes of human-computer interaction},

abstract = {How might one account for the organization in behavior without attributing it to an internal control structure? The present article develops a theoretical framework called behavioral dynamics that integrates an information-based approach to perception with a dynamical systems approach to action. For a given task, the agent and its environment are treated as a pair of dynamical systems that are coupled mechanically and informationally. Their interactions give rise to the behavioral dynamics, a vector field with attractors that correspond to stable task solutions, repellers that correspond to avoided states, and bifurcations that correspond to behavioral transitions. The framework is used to develop theories of several tasks in which a human agent interacts with the physical environment, including bouncing a ball on a racquet, balancing an object, braking a vehicle, and guiding locomotion. Stable, adaptive behavior emerges from the dynamics of the interaction between a structured environment and an agent with simple control laws, under physical and informational constraints.},

abstract = {Movement sequences such as typing or tapping display important interactions among finger movements arising from anticipatory motion (preparing for upcoming events) and coupling (non-independence among fingers). We examined pianists' finger tapping for the influence of cognitive chunking processes and biomechanical coupling constraints. In a synchronization-continuation task, pianists repeatedly tapped four-finger sequences that differed in terms of the chunks that formed subsequences and in the transitions among physically adjacent or non-adjacent fingers. Chunking influenced intertap intervals, regardless of the particular fingers tapped; the final tap of each chunk was lengthened and less variable relative to other taps. The particular fingers tapped influenced peak finger heights, consistency of motion, and velocity-acceleration patterns, regardless of chunking. Thus, cognitive constraints influenced timing, whereas biomechanical factors influenced motion trajectories. These findings provide an important caveat for study of anticipatory motion by documenting the influence of biomechanical coupling on motion trajectories.},

abstract = {It is generally accepted that augmented feedback, provided by a human expert or a technical display, effectively enhances motor learning. However, discussion of the way to most effectively provide augmented feedback has been controversial. Related studies have focused primarily on simple or artificial tasks enhanced by visual feedback. Recently, technical advances have made it possible also to investigate more complex, realistic motor tasks and to implement not only visual, but also auditory, haptic, or multimodal augmented feedback. The aim of this review is to address the potential of augmented unimodal and multimodal feedback in the framework of motor learning theories. The review addresses the reasons for the different impacts of feedback strategies within or between the visual, auditory, and haptic modalities and the challenges that need to be overcome to provide appropriate feedback in these modalities, either in isolation or in combination. Accordingly, the design criteria for successful visual, auditory, haptic, and multimodal feedback are elaborated.},

Acceptance rates for these algorithms can be quite low, resulting in slow exploration of the posterior distribution. We consider a variety of reversible jump strategies which allow inferences to be made in discretely observed HMMs, with particular emphasis placed on the comparison of the competing strategies in terms of computational expense, algebraic complexity and performance. The methods are illustrated with an application to the segmentation of DNA sequences into compositionally ho- mogeneous regions.},

@article{Jerde2003,
abstract = {In speech, the phenomenon of coarticulation (differentiation of phoneme production depending on the preceding or following phonemes) suggests an organization of movement sequences that is not strictly serial. In the skeletal motor system, however, evidence for comparable fluency has been lacking. Thus the present study was designed to quantify coarticulation in the hand movement sequences of sign language interpreters engaged in fingerspelling. Records of 17 measured joint angles were subjected to discriminant and correlation analyses to determine to what extent and in what manner the hand shape for a particular letter was influenced by the hand shapes for the preceding or the following letters. Substantial evidence of coarticulation was found, revealing both forward and reverse influences across letters. These influences could be further categorized as assimilation (tending to reduce the differences between sequential hand shapes) or dissimilation (tending to emphasize the differences between sequential hand shapes). The proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the index and middle fingers tended to show dissimilation, whereas at the same time (i.e., during the spelling of the same letters) the joints of the wrist and thumb tended to show assimilation. The index and middle finger PIP joints have been shown previously to be among the most important joints for computer recognition of the 26 letter shapes, and therefore the dissimilation may have served to enhance visual discrimination. The simultaneous occurrence of dissimilation in some joints and assimilation in others demonstrates an unprecedented level of parallel control of individual joint rotations in an essentially serial task.},

As an example, we propose the implementation of Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models to model gesture input, with a flexible structure that can be authored by the user. Moreover, some parameters can be adjusted through a learning phase. We show some examples of gesture segmentations based on this approach, considering several phases such as preparation, attack, sustain, release. Finally we describe an application, developed in Max/MSP, illustrating the use of accelerometer-based sen- sors to control phase vocoder synthesis techniques based on this approach.},

Monitoring the increase of fatigue during rehabilitation and sport exercises is beneficial to avoid the risk of injuries. This study investigates the use of a parametric hidden Markov model (PHMM) to estimate fatigue from observing kinematic changes in the way the exercise is performed. The PHMM is compared to linear regression. A top-level hidden Markov model with variable state transitions incorporates knowledge about the progress of fatigue during the exercise and the initial condition of a subject. The approach is tested on a squat database recorded with optical motion capture. The estimates of fatigue for a single squat, a set of squats, and an entire exercise correlate highly with subjective ratings.},

The time series model we use is the nonparametric Locally Stationary Wavelet model, in which a complete description of the piecewise-stationary second-order structure is provided by wavelet periodograms computed at multiple scales and locations. The initial stage of our method is a new binary segmentation procedure, with a theoretically justified and rapidly computable test criterion that detects breakpoints in wavelet periodograms separately at each scale. This is followed by within-scale and across-scales post-processing steps, leading to consistent estimation of the number and locations of breakpoints in the second-order structure of the original process. An extensive simulation study demon- strates good performance of our method.},

abstract = {This is a dissertation about performing music with computers, and about constructing the tools that will facilitate playing and improvising with these computers. The primary aim of this research is to construct a theoretical framework that could serve in evaluating the potential, the possibilities and the diversity of new digital musical instruments, with the hope that these ideas may inspire and assist the construction of new and powerful instruments with which perform and listen to wonderful new and previously unheard music. Computer-based interactive music systems date back to the late 1960s, initially involving computer-controlled analog synthesizers in concerts or installations. The use of real-time algorithmic composition spread in the 1970s with the work of composers and performers such as David Behrman, Joel Chadabe, Salvatore Martirano, Gordon Mumma or Laurie Spiegel. However the most rapid period of growth probably occurred during the mid 1980s with the MIDI standardization and, subsequently, with the advent of data-flow graphical programming languages such as Max, which made the design and implementation of custom interactive systems simpler than ever before. In spite of this, nearly four decades after the works of these pioneers, the design of computer-based music instruments, and computer music performance and improvisation in general, still seem immature multidisciplinary areas in which knowledge does not behave in incremental and accumulative ways, resulting in the permanent \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}reinvention of the wheel\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}. New digital instrument design is a broad field, encompassing highly technological areas (e.g. electronics and sensor technology, sound synthesis and processing techniques, software engineering, etc.), and disciplines related to the study of human behavior (e.g. psychology, physiology, ergonomics and human-computer interaction components, etc.). Much of this focused research attempts to solve independent parts of the problem an approach essential to achieve any progress in this field. However, as this dissertation will show, it is also clearly insufficient. I believe an approach dedicated to the integrated understanding of the whole is the key to achieving fruitful results. Integral studies and approaches, which consider not only ergonomic or technological but also psychological, philosophical, conceptual, musicological, historical and above all, musical issues, even if non-systematic by definition, are necessary for genuine progress. Putting forward the idea that a digital instrument is a conceptual whole, independent of its potential components and features (e.g. the ways it is controlled or its sonic or musical output tendencies), we will investigate the essence and the potential highlights of new digital instruments, the new musical models and the new music making paradigms they can convey. This dissertation begins with the assumption that better new musical instruments based on computers can only be conceived by exploring three parallel paths identifying the quintessence of new digital instruments; what they can bring of really original to the act of music performance; how can they redefine it; identifying the drawbacks or obsolescences of traditional instruments; what limitations or problems could be eliminated, improved or solved; without forgetting the essential generic assets of traditional instruments; those qualities that should never be forgotten nor discarded. The identification of these points is the primary aim of this thesis. There is a complex interconnected relationship between the tasks of imagining, designing and crafting musical computers, and performing and improvising with them. This relationship can only be understood as a permanent work in progress. This thesis comes from my own experience of fifteen years as a luthier-improviser. Therefore the dissertation is both theoretical (or conceptual) and experimental in approach, although the experiments it documents span years, even decades. To better organize this, the thesis is divided in three parts. Part I progressively enlightens the aforementioned three fundamental exploration paths. This is achieved by introducing the new possibilities offered by digital instruments, in addition to providing a thorough overview of current know-how and of the technical and conceptual frameworks in which new instrument designers and researchers are currently working on. Several taxonomies that will help us in developing a more synthetic and clear overview of the whole subject, are also presented. This first part concludes in chapter seven, presenting the first fundamental contribution of this dissertation; a theoretical framework for the evaluation of the expressive possibilities new digital musical instruments can offer to their performers. Part II describes in depth seven musical instruments, the implementations of my journeys into Digital Lutherie, developed during the previous decade. Since all seven are conceptually very different, each of them serves to illustrate several paradigms introduced in Part I. Presented in chronological order, these music instrument also help to clarify and understand of the path that has led me to the conception of the framework previously introduced. Part III incorporates the teachings and conclusions resulting from this evolutionary journey, and present the final milestone of this dissertation the presentation of possible solutions to better accomplish the goals presented at the end of the part I. Finally this dissertation concludes with what could be considered \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}my digital lutherie decalogue\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} which synthesizes most of the ideas introduced in the thesis. As a postlude, I offer the reacTable* to be presented as future work. The reacTable* is a digital instrument which constitutes the first one conceived from scratch, that takes into account all the concepts introduced in this thesis, the culmination thus far of my journey into Digital Lutherie},

abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of sensory integration for perceiving musical performance, a complex natural behavior. Thirty musically trained participants saw, heard, or both saw and heard, performances by two clarinetists. All participants used a sliding potentiometer to make continuous judgments of tension (a measure correlated with emotional response) and continuous judgments of phrasing (a measure correlated with perceived musical structure) as performances were presented. The data analysis sought to reveal relations between the sensory modalities (vision and audition) and to quantify the effect of seeing the performances on participants' overall subjective experience of the music. In addition to traditional statistics, functional data analysis techniques were employed to analyze time-varying aspects of the data. The auditory and visual channels were found to convey similar experiences of phrasing but different experiences of tension through much of the performances. We found that visual information served both to augment and to reduce the experience of tension at different points in the musical piece (as revealed by functional linear modeling and functional significance testing). In addition, the musicians' movements served to extend the sense of phrasing, to cue the beginning of new phrases, to indicate musical interpretation, and to anticipate changes in emotional content. Evidence for an interaction effect suggests that there may exist an emergent quality when musical performances are both seen and heard. The investigation augments knowledge of human communicative processes spanning language and music, and involving multiple modalities of emotion and information transfer.},

abstract = {Studies of learning, and in particular perceptual learning, have focused on learning of stimuli consisting of a single sensory modality. However, our experience in the world involves constant multisensory stimulation. For instance, visual and auditory information are integrated in performing many tasks that involve localizing and tracking moving objects. Therefore, it is likely that the human brain has evolved to develop, learn and operate optimally in multisensory environments. We suggest that training protocols that employ unisensory stimulus regimes do not engage multisensory learning mechanisms and, therefore, might not be optimal for learning. However, multisensory-training protocols can better approximate natural settings and are more effective for learning.},

abstract = {The major challenges that sign language recognition (SLR) now faces are developing methods that solve large-vocabulary continuous sign problems. In this paper, transition-movement models (TMMs) are proposed to handle transition parts between two adjacent signs in large-vocabulary continuous SLR. For tackling mass transition movements arisen from a large vocabulary size, a temporal clustering algorithm improved from k-means by using dynamic time warping as its distance measure is proposed to dynamically cluster them; then, an iterative segmentation algorithm for automatically segmenting transition parts from continuous sentences and training these TMMs through a bootstrap process is presented. The clustered TMMs due to their excellent generalization are very suitable for large-vocabulary continuous SLR. Lastly, TMMs together with sign models are viewed as candidates of the Viterbi search algorithm for recognizing continuous sign language. Experiments demonstrate that continuous SLR based on TMMs has good performance over a large vocabulary of 5113 Chinese signs and obtains an average accuracy of 91.9\%},

In this paper we develop a discriminative framework for simultaneous sequence segmentation and labeling which can capture both intrinsic and extrinsic class dynamics. Our approach incorporates hidden state variables which model the sub-structure of a class sequence and learn the dynamics between class labels. Each class label has a disjoint set of associated hidden states, which enables efficient training and inference in our model. We evaluated our method on the task of recognizing human gestures from unsegmented video streams and performed experiments on three different datasets of head and eye gestures. Our results demonstrate that our model for visual gesture recognition outperform models based on Support Vector Machines, Hidden Markov Models, and Conditional Random Fields.},

abstract = {Action selection is a fundamental decision process for us, and depends on the state of both our body and the environment. Because signals in our sensory and motor systems are corrupted by variability or noise, the nervous system needs to estimate these states. To select an optimal action these state estimates need to be combined with knowledge of the potential costs or rewards of different action outcomes. We review recent studies that have investigated the mechanisms used by the nervous system to solve such estimation and decision problems, which show that human behaviour is close to that predicted by Bayesian Decision Theory. This theory defines optimal behaviour in a world characterized by uncertainty, and provides a coherent way of describing sensorimotor processes.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a forward spotting method that handles hand gesture segmentation and recognition simul- taneously without time delay. To spot meaningful gestures of numbers (0-9) accurately, a stochastic method for designing a non-gesture model using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) is proposed without training data. The non-gesture model provides a confidence measures that are used as an adaptive threshold to find the start and the end point of meaningful gestures. Experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully recognize isolated gestures with 96.51\% and meaningful gestures with 90.49\% reliability.},

abstract = {Pressure, motion, and gesture are important parameters in musical instrument playing. Pressure sensing allows to in- terpret complex hidden forces, which appear during playing a musical instrument. The combination of our new sensor setup with pattern recognition techniques like the lately de- veloped ordered means models allows fast and precise recog- nition of highly skilled playing techniques. This includes left and right hand analysis as well as a combination of both. In this paper we show bow position recognition for string in- struments by means of support vector regression machines on the right hand finger pressure, as well as bowing recog- nition and inaccurate playing detection with ordered means models. We also introduce a new left hand and chin pressure sensing method for coordination and position change anal- ysis. Our methods in combination with our audio, video, and gesture recording software can be used for teaching and exercising. Especially studies of complex movements and finger force distribution changes can benefit from such an approach. Practical applications include the recognition of inaccuracy, cramping, or malposition, and, last but not least, the development of augmented instruments and new playing techniques.},

abstract = {This article examines methods, issues and controversies that have arisen over the last decade in the effort to organize sequences of DNA base information into homogeneous segments. An array of differ- ent models and techniques have been considered and applied. We demon- strate that most approaches can be embedded into a suitable version of the multiple change-point problem, and we review the various methods in this light. We also propose and discuss a promising local segmenta- tion method, namely, the application of split local polynomial fitting. The genome of bacteriophage A serves as an example sequence throughout the paper.},

@article{Achard2008,
abstract = {In this study a new approach is presented for the recognition of human actions of everyday life with a fixed camera. The originality of the presented method consists in characterizing sequences by a temporal succession of semi-global features, which are extracted from space-time micro-volumes . The advantage of this approach lies in the use of robust features (estimated on several frames) associated with the ability to manage actions with variable durations and easily segment the sequences with algorithms that are specific to time-varying data. Each action is actually characterized by a temporal sequence that constitutes the input of a Hidden Markov Model system for the recognition. Results presented of 1,614 sequences performed by several persons validate the proposed approach.},

@article{Stumpf2009,
abstract = {Although machine learning is becoming commonly used in today's software, there has been little research into how end users might interact with machine learning systems, beyond communicating simple "right/wrong" judgments. If the users themselves could work hand-in-hand with machine learning systems, the users' understanding and trust of the system could improve and the accuracy of learning systems could be improved as well. We conducted three experiments to understand the potential for rich interactions between users and machine learning systems. The first experiment was a think-aloud study that investigated users' willingness to interact with machine learning reasoning, and what kinds of feedback users might give to machine learning systems. We then investigated the viability of introducing such feedback into machine learning systems, specifically, how to incorporate some of these types of user feedback into machine learning systems, and what their impact was on the accuracy of the system. Taken together, the results of our experiments show that supporting rich interactions between users and machine learning systems is feasible for both user and machine. This shows the potential of rich human-computer collaboration via on-the-spot interactions as a promising direction for machine learning systems and users to collaboratively share intelligence.},

abstract = {The detection of repeated subsequences, time series motifs, is a problem which has been shown to have great utility for several higher-level data mining algorithms, including classification, clustering, segmentation, forecasting, and rule discovery. In recent years there has been significant research effort spent on efficiently discovering these motifs in static offline databases. However, for many domains, the inherent streaming nature of time series demands online discovery and maintenance of time series motifs. In this paper, we develop the first online motif discovery algorithm which monitors and maintains motifs exactly in real time over the most recent history of a stream. Our algorithm has a worst-case update time which is linear to the window size and is extendible to maintain more complex pattern structures. In contrast, the current offline algorithms either need significant update time or require very costly pre-processing steps which online algorithms simply cannot afford. Our core ideas allow useful extensions of our algorithm to deal with arbitrary data rates and discovering multidimensional motifs. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithms with a variety of case studies in the domains of robotics, acoustic monitoring and online compression.},

abstract = {In this paper we present research which can be placed in the context of performance-oriented computer music. Our research aims at finding new strategies for the realization of enactive interfaces for performers. We present an approach developed in experimental processes and we clarify it by introducing a concrete example. Our method involves physical modelling as an intermediate layer between bodily movement and sound synthesis. The historical and technological context in which this research takes place is outlined. We describe our approach and the hypotheses on which our investigations ground. The technological frame in which our research took place is briefly described. The piece cornerghostaxis\#1 is presented as an example of this approach. The observations made during the rehearsals and the performance of this piece are outlined. Grounding on ours and the performers' experiences, we indicate the most valuable qualities of this approach, sketch the direction our future experimentation and development will take, pointing out the issues we will concentrate on.},

We found neurons in monkey premotor cortex that discharge when the animal performs a specific action and when it hears the related sound. Most of the neurons also discharge when the monkey observes the same action. These audiovisual mirror neurons code actions independently of whether these actions are performed, heard, or seen. This discovery in the monkey homolog of Broca's area might shed light on the origin of language: audiovisual mirror neurons code abstract contents-the meaning of actions-and have the auditory access typical of human language to these contents.},

@article{Lemaitre2014,
abstract = {Describing unidentified sounds with words is a frustrating task and vocally imitating them is often a convenient way to address the issue. This article reports on a study that compared the effectiveness of vocal imitations and verbalizations to communicate different referent sounds. The stimuli included mechanical and synthesized sounds and were selected on the basis of participants' confidence in identifying the cause of the sounds, ranging from easy-to-identify to unidentifiable sounds. The study used a selection of vocal imitations and verbalizations deemed adequate descriptions of the referent sounds. These descriptions were used in a nine-alternative forced-choice experiment: Participants listened to a description and picked one sound from a list of nine possible referent sounds. Results showed that recognition based on verbalizations was maximally effective when the referent sounds were identifiable. Recognition accuracy with verbalizations dropped when identifiability of the sounds decreased. Conversely, recognition accuracy with vocal imitations did not depend on the identifiability of the referent sounds and was as high as with the best verbalizations. This shows that vocal imitations are an effective means of representing and communicating sounds and suggests that they could be used in a number of applications.},

These 'audiovisual mirror neurons' therefore represent actions independently of whether these actions are performed, heard or seen. The magnitude of auditory and visual responses did not differ significantly in half the neurons. A neurometric analysis revealed that based on the response of these neurons, two actions could be discriminated with 97\% accuracy.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in mining time series databases. As with most computer science problems, representation of the data is the key to efficient and effective solutions. One of the most commonly used representations is piecewise linear approximation. This representation has been used by various researchers to support clustering, classification, indexing and association rule mining of time series data. A variety of algorithms have been proposed to obtain this representation, with several algorithms having been independently rediscovered several times. In this paper, we undertake the first extensive review and empirical comparison of all proposed techniques. We show that all these algorithms have fatal flaws from a data mining perspective. We introduce a novel algorithm that we empirically show to be superior to all others in the literature.},

@article{Seo2011,
abstract = {We present a novel action recognition method based on space-time locally adaptive regression kernels and the matrix cosine similarity measure. The proposed method uses a single example of an action as a query to find similar matches. It does not require prior knowledge about actions, foreground/background segmentation, or any motion estimation or tracking. Our method is based on the computation of novel space-time descriptors from the query video which measure the likeness of a voxel to its surroundings. Salient features are extracted from said descriptors and compared against analogous features from the target video. This comparison is done using a matrix generalization of the cosine similarity measure. The algorithm yields a scalar resemblance volume, with each voxel indicating the likelihood of similarity between the query video and all cubes in the target video. Using nonparametric significance tests by controlling the false discovery rate, we detect the presence and location of actions similar to the query video. High performance is demonstrated on challenging sets of action data containing fast motions, varied contexts, and complicated background. Further experiments on the Weizmann and KTH data sets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in action categorization.},

@article{medeiros2014ccomprehensive,
abstract = {Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) are musical instruments typically composed of a control surface where user interaction is measured by sensors whose values are mapped to sound synthesis algorithms. These instruments have gained interest among skilled musicians and performers in the last decades leading to artistic practices including musical performance, interactive installations and dance. The creation of DMIs typically involves several areas, among them: arts, design and engineering. The balance between these areas is an essential task in DMI design so that the resulting instruments are aesthetically appealing, robust, and allow responsive, accurate and repeatable sensing. In this paper, we review the use of sensors in the DMI community as manifested in the proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME 2009–2013). Focusing on the sensor technologies and signal conditioning techniques used by the NIME community. Although it has been claimed that specifications for artistic tools are harder than those for military applications, this study raises a paradox showing that in most of the cases, DMIs are based on a few basic sensors types and unsophisticated engineering solutions, not taking advantage of more advanced sensing, instrumentation and signal processing techniques that could dramatically improve their response. We aim to raise awareness of limitations of any engineering solution and to assert the benefits of advanced electronics instrumentation design in DMIs. For this, we propose the use of specialized sensors such as strain gages, advanced conditioning circuits and signal processing tools such as sensor fusion. We believe that careful electronic instrumentation design may lead to more responsive instruments.},

abstract = {Loss of functional movement is a common consequence of stroke for which a wide range of interventions has been developed. In this Review, we aimed to provide an overview of the available evidence on interventions for motor recovery after stroke through the evaluation of systematic reviews, supplemented by recent randomised controlled trials. Most trials were small and had some design limitations. Improvements in recovery of arm function were seen for constraint-induced movement therapy, electromyographic biofeedback, mental practice with motor imagery, and robotics. Improvements in transfer ability or balance were seen with repetitive task training, biofeedback, and training with a moving platform. Physical fitness training, high-intensity therapy (usually physiotherapy), and repetitive task training improved walking speed. Although the existing evidence is limited by poor trial designs, some treatments do show promise for improving motor recovery, particularly those that have focused on high-intensity and repetitive task-specific practice.},

abstract = {Objective: To study the use of auditory feedback for gait management and rehabilitation in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Methods: An auditory feedback cue, responding to the patient's own steps in closed-loop, was produced by a wearable motion sensor and delivered to the patient through ear phones. On-line (device on) and residual short-term therapeutic effects on walking speed and stride length were measured in fourteen randomly selected patients with gait disturbances predominantly due to cerebellar ataxia. Results: Patients showed an average improvement of 12.84\% on-line and 18.75\% residually in walking speed. Average improvement in stride length was 8.30\% on-line and 9.93\% residually. The improvement results are particularly noteworthy when compared with the lack of change in healthy control subjects. Conclusions: Patients with MS using auditory feedback cues showed improvement in walking abilities. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{esling2013multiobjective,
abstract = {Seeking sound samples in a massive database can be a tedious and time consuming task. Even when metadata are available, query results may remain far from the timbre expected by users. This problem stems from the nature of query specification, which does not account for the underlying complexity of audio data. The Query By Example (QBE) paradigm tries to tackle this shortcoming by finding audio clips similar to a given sound example. However, it requires users to have a well-formed soundfile of what they seek, which is not always a valid assumption. Furthermore, most audio-retrieval systems rely on a single measure of similarity, which is unlikely to convey the perceptual similarity of audio signals. We address in this paper an innovative way of querying generic audio databases by simultaneously optimizing the temporal evolution of multiple spectral properties. We show how this problem can be cast into a new approach merging multiobjective optimization and time series matching, called MultiObjective Time Series (MOTS) matching. We formally state this problem and report an efficient implementation. This approach introduces a multidimensional assessment of similarity in audio matching. This allows to cope with the multidimensional nature of timbre perception and also to obtain a set of efficient propositions rather than a single best solution. To demonstrate the performances of our approach, we show its efficiency in audio classification tasks. By introducing a selection criterion based on the hypervolume dominated by a class, we show that our approach outstands the state-of-art methods in audio classification even with a few number of features. We demonstrate its robustness to several classes of audio distortions. Finally, we introduce two innovative applications of our method for sound querying. © 2006-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Many successful applications of computer vision to image or video manipulation are interactive by nature. However, parameters of such systems are often trained neglecting the user. Traditionally, interactive systems have been treated in the same manner as their fully automatic counterparts. Their performance is evaluated by computing the accuracy of their solutions under some fixed set of user interactions. This paper proposes a new evaluation and learning method which brings the user in the loop. It is based on the use of an active robot user - a simulated model of a human user. We show how this approach can be used to evaluate and learn parameters of state-of-the-art interactive segmentation systems. We also show how simulated user models can be integrated into the popular max-margin method for parameter learning and propose an algorithm to solve the resulting optimisation problem.},

Reciprocally, the second part studies why tabletop interfaces promise remarkable new musical instruments. The third part describes the main design issues that lead to the development of the reactable, a tabletop musical instrument that has been conceived based on many of the criteria exposed on the previous two parts.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a realtime system for continuous gesture segmentation and recognition. The model is an extension of the system called Gesture Follower developed at Ircam, which is an hybrid model between Dynamic Time Warping and Hidden Markov Models. This previous model allows for a realtime temporal alignment between a template and an input gesture. Our model extends it by proposing a higher-level structure which models the switching between templates. Taking advantage of a representation as a Dynamic Bayesian Networks, the time complexity of the inference algorithms is reduced from cubic to linear in the length of the observation sequence. We propose various segmentation methods, both offline and realtime. A quantitative evaluation of the proposed model on accelerometer sensor data provides a comparison with the Segmental Hidden Markov Model, and we discuss several sub-optimal methods for realtime segmentation. Our model reveals able to handle signal distortions due to speed variations in the execution of gestures. Finally, a musical application is outlined in a case study about the segmentation of violin bow strokes.},

It is important not only for communication and recognition at a distance, but also for the learning of complex motor actions by imitation. Movement recognition has been studied in psychophysical, neurophysiological and imaging experiments, and several cortical areas involved in it have been identified. We use a neurophysiologically plausible and quantitative model as a tool for organizing and making sense of the experimental data, despite their growing size and complexity. We review the main experimental findings and discuss possible neural mechanisms, and show that a learning-based, feedforward model provides a neurophysiologically plausible and consistent summary of many key experimental results.},

@phdthesis{serra1989thesis,
abstract = {This dissertation introduces a new analysis/synthesis method. It is designed to obtain musically useful intermediate representations for sound transformations. The method\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s underlying model assumes that a sound is composed of a deterministic component plus a stochastic one. The deterministic component is represented by a series of sinusoids that are described by amplitude and frequency functions. The stochastic component is represented by a series of magnitude-spectrum envelopes that function as a time-varying filter excited by white noise. Together these representations make it possible for a synthesized sound to attain all the perceptual characteristics of the original sound. At the same time the representation is easily modified to create a wide variety of new sounds. This analysis/synthesis technique is based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). From the set of spectra returned by the STFT, the relevant peaks of each spectrum are detected and used as breakpoints in a set of frequency trajectories. The deterministic signal is obtained by synthesizing a sinusoid from each trajectory. Then, in order to obtain the stochastic component, a set of spectra of the deterministic component is computed, and these spectra are subtracted from the spectra of the original sound. The resulting spectral residuals are approximated by a series of envelopes, from which the stochastic signal is generated by performing an inverse-STFT. The result is a method that is appropriate for the manipulation of sounds. The intermediate representation is very flexible and musically useful in that it offers unlimited possibilities for transformation.},

abstract = {Sound generators and synthesis engines expose a large set of parameters, allowing run-time timbre morphing and exploration of sonic space. However, control over these high-dimensional interfaces is constrained by the physical limitations of performers. In this paper we propose the exploitation of vocal gesture as an extension or alternative to traditional physical controllers. The approach uses dynamic aspects of vocal sound to control variations in the timbre of the synthesized sound. The mapping from vocal to synthesis parameters is automatically adapted to information extracted from vocal examples as well as to the relationship between parameters and timbre within the synthesizer. The mapping strategy aims to maximize the breadth of the explorable perceptual sonic space over a set of the synthesizer's real-valued parameters, indirectly driven by the voice-controlled interface.},

@article{Sosnik2004,
abstract = {The skilled generation of motor sequences involves the appropriate choice, ordering and timing of a sequence of simple, stereotyped movement elements. Nevertheless, a given movement element within a well-rehearsed sequence can be modified through interaction with its neighboring elements (co-articulation). We show that extensive training on a sequence of planar hand trajectories passing through several targets resulted in the co-articulation of movement components, and in the formation of new movement elements (primitives). Reduction in movement duration was accompanied by the gradual replacement of straight trajectories by longer curved ones, the latter affording the maximization of movement smoothness. Surprisingly, the curved trajectories were generated even when new target configurations were introduced, i.e., when target distances were scaled, movement direction reversed or when different start and end positions were used, indicating the acquisition of geometrically defined movement elements. However, the new trajectories were not shared by the untrained hand. Altogether, our results suggest that novel movement elements can be acquired through extensive training in adults.},

Interaction between musicians, correspond to their cultural background, subjective reaction around the generated material and their capabilities to resolve in their own terms the aesthetics of the resultant pieces. In this paper we introduce GRI an environment, which incorporates music and movement gestures from an improviser to adquire precise data and react in a similar way as an improviser. GRI takes music samples from a particular improviser and learns a classifiers to identify different improvision styles. It then learns for each style a probabilistic transition automaton that considers gestures to predict the most probable next state of the musician. The current musical note, the predicted next state, and gesture information are used to produce adequate responses in real-time. The system is demonstrated with a flutist, with accelerometers and gyros to detect gestures with very promising results.},

@article{ijspeert2013dynamical,
abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems have been used in many disciplines to model complex behaviors, including biological motor control, robotics, perception, economics, traffic prediction, and neuroscience. While often the unexpected emergent behavior of nonlinear systems is the focus of investigations, it is of equal importance to create goal-directed behavior (e.g., stable locomotion from a system of coupled oscillators under perceptual guidance). Modeling goal-directed behavior with nonlinear systems is, however, rather difficult due to the parameter sensitivity of these systems, their complex phase transitions in response to subtle parameter changes, and the difficulty of analyzing and predicting their long-term behavior; intuition and time-consuming parameter tuning play a major role. This letter presents and reviews dynamical movement primitives, a line of research for modeling attractor behaviors of autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems with the help of statistical learning techniques. The essence of our approach is to start with a simple dynamical system, such as a set of linear differential equations, and transform those into a weakly nonlinear system with prescribed attractor dynamics by means of a learnable autonomous forcing term. Both point attractors and limit cycle attractors of almost arbitrary complexity can be generated. We explain the design principle of our approach and evaluate its properties in several example applications in motor control and robotics.},

@article{Gallese2005,
abstract = {Concepts are the elementary units of reason and linguistic meaning. They are conventional and relatively stable. As such, they must somehow be the result of neural activity in the brain. The questions are: Where? and How? A common philosophical position is that all concepts-even concepts about action and perception-are symbolic and abstract, and therefore must be implemented outside the brain's sensory-motor system. We will argue against this position using (1) neuroscientific evidence; (2) results from neural computation; and (3) results about the nature of concepts from cognitive linguistics. We will propose that the sensory-motor system has the right kind of structure to characterise both sensory-motor and more abstract concepts. Central to this picture are the neural theory of language and the theory of cogs, according to which, brain structures in the sensory-motor regions are exploited to characterise the so-called "abstract" concepts that constitute the meanings of grammatical constructions and general inference patterns.},

abstract = {The capacity for real-time synchronization and coordination is a common ability among trained musicians performing a music score that presents an interesting challenge for machine intelligence. Compared to speech recognition, which has influenced many music information retrieval systems, music's temporal dynamics and complexity pose challenging problems to common approximations regarding time modeling of data streams. In this paper, we propose a design for a real-time music-to-score alignment system. Given a live recording of a musician playing a music score, the system is capable of following the musician in real time within the score and decoding the tempo (or pace) of its performance. The proposed design features two coupled audio and tempo agents within a unique probabilistic inference framework that adaptively updates its parameters based on the real-time context. Online decoding is achieved through the collaboration of the coupled agents in a Hidden Hybrid Markov/semi-Markov framework, where prediction feedback of one agent affects the behavior of the other. We perform evaluations for both real-time alignment and the proposed temporal model. An implementation of the presented system has been widely used in real concert situations worldwide and the readers are encouraged to access the actual system and experiment the results.},

abstract = {We present a novel technique for the recognition of complex human gestures for video annotation using accelerometers and the hidden Markov model. Our extension to the standard hidden Markov model allows us to consider gestures at different levels of abstraction through a hierarchy of hidden states. Accelerometers in the form of wrist bands are attached to humans performing intentional gestures, such as umpires in sports. Video annotation is then performed by populating the video with time stamps indicating significant events, where a particular gesture occurs. The novelty of the technique lies in the development of a probabilistic hierarchical framework for complex gesture recognition and the use of accelerometers to extract gestures and significant events for video annotation.},

@article{Fowler2006,
abstract = {This article reports three experiments designed to explore the basis for speech perceivers' apparent compensations for coarticulation. In the first experiment, the stimuli were members of three /da/-to-/ga/ continua hybridized from natural speech. The monosyllables had originally been produced in disyllables /ada/ and /aga/ to make Continuum 1, /alda/ and /alga/ (Continuum 2), and /arda/ and /arga/ (Continuum 3). Members of the second and third continua were influenced by carryover coarticulation from the preceding /l/ or /r/ context. Listeners showed compensation for this carryover coarticulation in the absence of the precursor /al/ or /ar/ syllables. This rules out an account in which compensation for coarticulation reflects a spectral contrast effect exerted by a precursor syllable, as previously has been proposed by Lotto, Holt, and colleagues (e.g., Lotto, Kluender, \& Holt, 1997; Lotto \& Kluender, 1998). The second experiment showed an enhancing effect of the endpoint monosyllables in Experiment 1 on identifications of preceding natural hybrids along an /al/-to-/ar/ continuum. That is, coarticulatory /l/ and /r/ information in /da/ and /ga/ syllables led to increased judgments of /l/ and /r/, respectively, in the precursor /al/-to-/ar/ continuum members. This was opposite to the effect, in Experiment 3, of /da/ and /ga/ syllables on preceding tones synthesized to range in frequency from approximately the ending F3 of /ar/ to the ending F3 of /al/. The enhancing, not contrastive, effect in Experiment 2, juxtaposed to the contrastive effect in Experiment 3, further disconfirms the spectral contrast account of compensation for coarticulation. A review of the literature buttresses that conclusion and provides strong support for an account that invokes listeners' attention to information in speech for the occurrence of gestural overlap.},

@article{Fogarty2008,
abstract = {Web image search is difficult in part because a handful of keywords are generally insufficient for characterizing the visual properties of an image. Popular engines have begun to provide tags based on simple characteristics of images (such as tags for black and white images or images that contain a face), but such approaches are limited by the fact that it is unclear what tags end users want to be able to use in examining Web image search results. This paper presents CueFlik, a Web image search application that allows end users to quickly create their own rules for re ranking images based on their visual characteristics. End users can then re rank any future Web image search results according to their rule. In an experiment we present in this paper, end users quickly create effective rules for such concepts as "product photos", "portraits of people", and "clipart". When asked to conceive of and create their own rules, participants create such rules as "sports action shot" with images from queries for "basketball" and "football". CueFlik represents both a promising new approach to Web image search and an important study in end user interactive machine learning.},

In Study 1, the causal uncertainty of 96 sounds was measured by counting the different causes described by 29 participants. In Study 2, 15 experts and 15 nonexperts classified a selection of 60 sounds and indicated the similarities they used. In Study 3, 38 participants indicated their confidence in identifying the sounds. Participants reported using either acoustical similarities or similarities of the causes of the sounds. Experts used acoustical similarity more often than nonexperts, who used the similarity of the cause of the sounds. Sounds with a low causal uncertainty were more often grouped together because of the similarities of the cause, whereas sounds with a high causal uncertainty were grouped together more often because of the acoustical similarities. The same conclusions were reached for identification confidence. This measure allowed the sound classification to be predicted, and is a straightforward method to determine the appropriate description of a sound.},

@article{Alon2009,
abstract = {Within the context of hand gesture recognition, spatiotemporal gesture segmentation is the task of determining, in a video sequence, where the gesturing hand is located and when the gesture starts and ends. Existing gesture recognition methods typically assume either known spatial segmentation or known temporal segmentation, or both. This paper introduces a unified framework for simultaneously performing spatial segmentation, temporal segmentation, and recognition. In the proposed framework, information flows both bottom-up and top-down. A gesture can be recognized even when the hand location is highly ambiguous and when information about when the gesture begins and ends is unavailable. Thus, the method can be applied to continuous image streams where gestures are performed in front of moving, cluttered backgrounds. The proposed method consists of three novel contributions: a spatiotemporal matching algorithm that can accommodate multiple candidate hand detections in every frame, a classifier-based pruning framework that enables accurate and early rejection of poor matches to gesture models, and a subgesture reasoning algorithm that learns which gesture models can falsely match parts of other longer gestures. The performance of the approach is evaluated on two challenging applications: recognition of hand-signed digits gestured by users wearing short-sleeved shirts, in front of a cluttered background, and retrieval of occurrences of signs of interest in a video database containing continuous, unsegmented signing in American Sign Language (ASL).},

LMA provides a good compromise between high-level semantic features, which are dif- ficult to extract for general motions, and low-level kinematic features which, often yield unsophisticated segmentations. The LMA features are computed using a collection of neural networks trained with temporal variance in order to create a classifier that is more robust with regard to input boundaries. The actual segmentation points are derived through simple time series analysis of the LMA features.},

@misc{Gallese1998,
abstract = {A new class of visuomotor neuron has been recently discovered in the monkey's premotor cortex: mirror neurons. These neurons respond both when a particular action is performed by the recorded monkey and when the same action, performed by another individual, is observed. Mirror neurons appear to form a cortical system matching observation and execution of goal-related motor actions. Experimental evidence suggests that a similar matching system also exists in humans. What might be the functional role of this matching system? One possible function is to enable an organism to detect certain mental states of observed conspecifics. This function might be part of, or a precursor to, a more general mind-reading ability. Two different accounts of mind-reading have been suggested. According to 'theory theory', mental states are represented as inferred posits of a naive theory. According to 'simulation theory', other people's mental shares are represented by adopting their perspective: by tracking or matching their states with resonant states of one's own. The activity of mirror neurons, and the fact that observers undergo motor facilitation in the same muscular groups as those utilized by target agents, are findings that accord well with simulation theory but would not be predicted by theory theory.},

Models are constructed by incrementally refining and regularizing the structure of a simple generative model for genotype data under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.},

abstract = {Echo State Networks (ESNs), a form of recurrent neural network developed in the field of Reservoir Computing, show significant potential for use as a tool in the design of mappings for digital musical instruments. They have, however, seldom been used in this area, so this paper explores their possible uses. This project contributes a new open source library, which was developed to allow ESNs to run in the Pure Data dataflow environment. Several use cases were explored, focusing on addressing current issues in mapping research. ESNs were found to work successfully in scenarios of pattern classification, multiparametric control, explorative mapping and the design of nonlinearities and uncontrol. $\backslash$emph\{Un-trained\} behaviours are proposed, as augmentations to the conventional reservoir system that allow the player to introduce potentially interesting non-linearities and uncontrol into the reservoir. Interactive evolution style controls are proposed as strategies to help design these behaviours, which are otherwise dependent on arbitrary parameters. A study on sound classification shows that ESNs can reliably differentiate between two drum sounds, and also generalise to other similar input. Following evaluation of the use cases, heuristics are proposed to aid the use of ESNs in computer music scenarios.},

We first state explicitly what such control would entail, and we observe that if a movement sequence is planned hierarchically, that does not imply that its execution is hierarchical. To find evidence for hierarchically controlled execution, we require subjects to perform memorized sequences of finger responses like those used in playing the piano. The error data we obtain are consistent with a hierarchical planning as well as execution model, but the interresponse-time data provide strong support for a hierarchical execution model. We consider three alternatives to the hierarchical execution model and reject them. We also consider the implications of our results for the role of timing in motor programs, the characteristics of motor buffers, and the relations between memory for symbolic and motor information.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper is about mapping strategies between gesture data and synthesis model parameters by means of perceptual spaces. We define three layers in the mapping chain: from gesture data to gesture perceptual space, from sound perceptual space to synthesis model parameters, and between the two perceptual spaces. This approach makes the implementation highly modular. Both perceptual spaces are developed and depicted with their features. To get a simple mapping between the gesture perceptual subspace and the sound perceptual subspace, we need to focus our attention on the two other mappings. We explain the mapping types: explicit/implicit, static/dynamic. We also present the technical and aesthetical limits introduced by mapping. Some practical examples are given of the use of perceptual spaces in experiments done at LMA in a musical context. Finally, we discuss several implications of the mapping strategies: the influence of chosen mapping limits onto performers' virtuosity, and the incidence of mapping on the learning process with virtual instruments and on improvisation possibilities.},

@article{ORegan2001,
abstract = {Many current neurophysiological, psychophysical, and psychological approaches to vision rest on the idea that when we see, the brain produces an internal representation of the world. The activation of this internal representation is assumed to give rise to the experience of seeing. The problem with this kind of approach is that it leaves unexplained how the existence of such a detailed internal representation might produce visual consciousness. An alternative proposal is made here. We propose that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations does not generate the experience of seeing. The outside world serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the governing laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different sensory modalities. Several lines of empirical evidence are brought forward in support of the theory, in particular: evidence from experiments in sensorimotor adaptation, visual "filling in," visual stability despite eye movements, change blindness, sensory substitution, and color perception.},

We demonstrate that our hybrid model achieves error reductions of 18\% and 25\% over a standard order-1 CRF and a semi-Markov CRF (resp.) on the task of Chinese word segmentation. We also propose the use of a powerful fea- ture for the semi-Markov CRF: the log conditional odds that a given token se- quence constitutes a chunk according to a generative model, which reduces error by an additional 13\%. Our best system achieves 96.8\% F-measure, the highest reported score on this test set.},

Current, advanced technologies facilitate the design of novel biofeedback systems that possess diverse parameters, advanced cue display, and sophisticated control systems for use in task-oriented biofeedback. In light of these advancements, this article: (1) reviews early biofeedback studies and their conclusions; (2) presents recent developments in biofeedback technologies and their applications to task-oriented biofeedback interventions; and (3) discusses considerations regarding the therapeutic system design and the clinical application of task-oriented biofeedback therapy.

abstract = {This thesis examines machine learning through the lens of human-computer interac- tion in order to address fundamental questions surrounding the application of machine learning to real-life problems, including: Can we make machine learning algorithms more usable and useful? Can we better understand the real-world consequences of algorithm choices and user interface designs for end-user machine learning? How can human interaction play a role in enabling users to efficiently create useful machine learning systems, in enabling successful application of algorithms by machine learning novices, and in ultimately making it possible in practice to apply machine learning to new problems? The scope of the research presented here is the application of supervised learning algorithms to contemporary computer music composition and performance. Com- puter music is a domain rich with computational problems requiring the modeling of complex phenomena, the construction of real-time interactive systems, and the sup- port of human creativity. Though varied, many of these problems may be addressed using machine learning techniques, including supervised learning in particular. This work endeavors to gain a deeper knowledge of the human factors surrounding the application of supervised learning to these types of problems, to make supervised learning algorithms more usable by musicians, and to study how supervised learning can function as a creative tool. This thesis presents a general-purpose software system for applying standard su- pervised learning algorithms in music and other real-time problem domains. This system, called the Wekinator, supports human interaction throughout the entire su- pervised learning process, including the generation of training examples and the ap- plication of trained models to real-time inputs. The Wekinator is published as a freely-available, open source software project, and several composers have already employed it in the creation of new musical instruments and compositions. This thesis also presents work utilizing the Wekinator to study human-computer interaction with supervised learning in computer music. Research is presented which includes a participatory design process with practicing composers, pedagogical use with non-expert users in an undergraduate classroom, a study of the design of a gesture recognition system for a sensor-augmented cello bow, and case studies with three composers who have used the system in completed artistic works. The primary contributions of this work include (1) a new software tool allowing real-time human interaction with supervised learning algorithms, which includes a novel playalong interaction for generating training data in real-time; (2) a demon- stration of the important roles that interactionencompassing both human-computer control and computer-human feedbackcan play in the development of supervised learning systems, and a greater understanding of the differences between interactive and conventional machine learning contexts; (3) a better understanding of the re- quirements and challenges in the analysis and design of algorithms and interfaces for interactive supervised learning in real-time and creative problem domains; (4) a clearer characterization of composers goals and priorities for interacting with com- puters in music composition and instrument design; and (5) a demonstration of the usefulness of interactive supervised learning as a creativity support tool. This work both empowers musicians to create new forms of art and contributes to a broader HCI perspective on machine learning practice.},

abstract = {Gesture-to-sound mapping is generally defined as the association between gestural and sound parameters. This article describes an approach that brings forward the perception-action loop as a fundamental design principle for gesture–sound mapping in digital music instrument. Our approach considers the processes of listening as the foundation – and the first step – in the design of action-sound relationships. In this design process, the relationship between action and sound is derived from actions that can be perceived in the sound. Building on previous works on listening modes and gestural descriptions we proposed to distinguish between three mapping strategies: instantaneous, temporal, and metaphoric. Our approach makes use of machine learning techniques for building prototypes, from digital music instruments to interactive installations. Four different examples of scenarios and prototypes are described and discussed.},

abstract = {Gesture sequences typically have a common set of distinct internal sub-structures which can be shared across the gestures. In this paper, we propose a method using a generative model to learn these common actions which we refer to as sub-gestures, and in-turn perform recognition. Our proposed model learns sub-gestures by sharing parameters between gesture models. We evaluated our method on the Palm Graffiti digits-gesture dataset and showed that the model with shared parameters outperformed the same model without the shared parameters. Also, we labeled different observation sequences thereby intuitively showing how sub-gestures are related to complete gestures.},

abstract = {This paper presents a robust framework for online full-body gesture spotting from visual hull data. Using view-invariant pose features as observations, hidden Markov models (HMMs) are trained for gesture spotting from continuous movement data streams. Two major contributions of this paper are 1) view-invariant pose feature extraction from visual hulls, and 2) a systematic approach to automatically detecting and modeling specific nongesture movement patterns and using their HMMs for outlier rejection in gesture spotting. The experimental results have shown the view-invariance property of the proposed pose features for both training poses and new poses unseen in training, as well as the efficacy of using specific nongesture models for outlier rejection. Using the IXMAS gesture data set, the proposed framework has been extensively tested and the gesture spotting results are superior to those reported on the same data set obtained using existing state-of-the-art gesture spotting methods.},

@article{Schaal2005,
abstract = {This paper discusses a comprehensive framework for modular motor control based on a recently developed theory of dynamic movement primitives (DMP). DMPs are a formulation of movement primitives with autonomous nonlinear differential equations, whose time evolution creates smooth kinematic control policies. Model-based control theory is used to convert the outputs of these policies into motor commands. By means of coupling terms, on-line modifications can be incorporated into the time evolution of the differential equations, thus providing a rather flexible and reactive framework for motor planning and execution. The linear parameterization of DMPs lends itself naturally to supervised learning from demonstration. Moreover, the temporal, scale, and translation invariance of the differential equations with respect to these parameters provides a useful means for movement recognition. A novel reinforcement learning technique based on natural stochastic policy gradients allows a general approach of improving DMPs by trial and error learning with respect to almost arbitrary optimization criteria. We demonstrate the different ingredients of the DMP approach in various examples, involving skill learning from demonstration on the humanoid robot DB, and learning biped walking from demonstration in simulation, including self-improvement of the movement patterns towards energy efficiency through resonance tuning.},

abstract = {A central problem in motor control is understanding how the many biomechanical degrees of freedom are coordinated to achieve a common goal. An especially puzzling aspect of coordination is that behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Existing theoretical frameworks emphasize either goal achievement or the richness of motor variability, but fail to reconcile the two. Here we propose an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal feedback control. We show that the optimal strategy in the face of uncertainty is to allow variability in redundant (task-irrelevant) dimensions. This strategy does not enforce a desired trajectory, but uses feedback more intelligently, correcting only those deviations that interfere with task goals. From this framework, task-constrained variability, goal-directed corrections, motor synergies, controlled parameters, simplifying rules and discrete coordination modes emerge naturally. We present experimental results from a range of motor tasks to support this theory.},

@inproceedings{tokuda2000algorithms,
abstract = {This paper derives a speech parameter generation algorithm for HMM-based speech synthesis, in which the speech parameter sequence is generated from HMMs whose observation vector consists of a spectral parameter vector and its dynamic feature vectors. In the algorithm, we assume that the state sequence (state and mixture sequence for the multi-mixture case) or a part of the state sequence is unobservable (i.e., hidden or latent). As a result, the algorithm iterates the forward-backward algorithm and the parameter generation algorithm for the case where the state sequence is given. Experimental results show that by using the algorithm, we can reproduce clear formant structure from multi-mixture HMMs as compared with that produced from single-mixture HMMs},

abstract = {Programming an audio synthesizer can be a difficult task for many. However, if a user has a general idea of the sound they are trying to program, they may be able to imitate it with their voice. This paper presents SynthAssist, a system for interactively searching the synthesis space of an audio synthesizer. In this work, we present how to use the system for querying a database of audio synthesizer patches (i.e. settings/parameters) by vocal imitation and user feed- back. To account for the limitations of the human voice, it uses both absolute and relative time series representations of features and relevance feedback on both the feature weights and time series to refine the query. The method presented in this paper can be used to search through large databases of previously existing ``factory presets" or program a synthesizer using the data-driven approach to automatic synthesizer programming.},

@article{Kirsh2013a,
abstract = {The theory of embodied cognition can provide HCI practitioners and theorists with new ideas about interaction and new principles for better designs. I support this claim with four ideas about cognition: (1) interacting with tools changes the way we think and perceive -- tools, when manipulated, are soon absorbed into the body schema, and this absorption leads to fundamental changes in the way we perceive and conceive of our environments; (2) we think with our bodies not just with our brains; (3) we know more by doing than by seeing -- there are times when physically performing an activity is better than watching someone else perform the activity, even though our motor resonance system fires strongly during other person observation; (4) there are times when we literally think with things. These four ideas have major implications for interaction design, especially the design of tangible, physical, context aware, and telepresence systems.},

abstract = {The field of sonification has progressed greatly over the past twenty years and currently constitutes an established area of research. This article aims at exploiting and organizing the knowledge accumulated in previous experimental studies to build a foundation for future sonification works. A systematic review of these studies may reveal trends in sonification design, and therefore support the development of design guidelines. To this end, we have reviewed and analyzed 179 scientific publications related to sonification of physical quantities. Using a bottom-up approach, we set up a list of conceptual dimensions belonging to both physical and auditory domains. Mappings used in the reviewed works were identified, forming a database of 495 entries. Frequency of use was analyzed among these conceptual dimensions as well as higher-level categories. Results confirm two hypotheses formulated in a preliminary study: pitch is by far the most used auditory dimension in sonification applications, and spatial auditory dimensions are almost exclusively used to sonify kinematic quantities. To detect successful as well as unsuccessful sonification strategies, assessment of mapping efficiency conducted in the reviewed works was considered. Results show that a proper evaluation of sonification mappings is performed only in a marginal proportion of publications. Additional aspects of the publication database were investigated: historical distribution of sonification works is presented, projects are classified according to their primary function, and the sonic material used in the auditory display is discussed. Finally, a mapping-based approach for characterizing sonification is proposed.},

abstract = {Movement imitation requires a complex set of mechanisms that map an observed movement of a teacher onto one's own movement apparatus. Relevant problems include movement recognition, pose estimation, pose tracking, body correspondence, coordinate transformation from external to egocentric space, matching of observed against previously learned movement, resolution of redundant degrees-of-freedom that are unconstrained by the observation, suitable movement representations for imitation, modularization of motor control, etc. All of these topics by themselves are active research problems in computational and neurobiological sciences, such that their combination into a complete imitation system remains a daunting undertaking-indeed, one could argue that we need to understand the complete perception-action loop. As a strategy to untangle the complexity of imitation, this paper will examine imitation purely from a computational point of view, i.e. we will review statistical and mathematical approaches that have been suggested for tackling parts of the imitation problem, and discuss their merits, disadvantages and underlying principles. Given the focus on action recognition of other contributions in this special issue, this paper will primarily emphasize the motor side of imitation, assuming that a perceptual system has already identified important features of a demonstrated movement and created their corresponding spatial information. Based on the formalization of motor control in terms of control policies and their associated performance criteria, useful taxonomies of imitation learning can be generated that clarify different approaches and future research directions.},

@article{Jacobs2002,
abstract = {Previous researchers developed new learning architectures for sequential data by extending conventional hidden Markov models through the use of distributed state representations. Although exact inference and parameter estimation in these architectures is computationally intractable, Ghahramani and Jordan (1997) showed that approximate inference and parameter estimation in one such architecture, factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs), is feasible in certain circumstances. However, the learning algorithm proposed by these investigators, based on variational techniques, is difficult to understand and implement and is limited to the study of real-valued data sets. This chapter proposes an alternative method for approximate inference and parameter estimation in FHMMs based on the perspective that FHMMs are a generalization of a well-known class of statistical models known as generalized additive models (GAMs; Hastie \& Tibshirani, 1990). Using existing statistical techniques for GAMs as a guide, we have developed the generalized backfitting algorithm. This algorithm computes customized error signals for each hidden Markov chain of an FHMM and then trains each chain one at a time using conventional techniques from the hidden Markov models literature. Relative to previous perspectives on FHMMs, we believe that the viewpoint taken here has a number of advantages. First, it places FHMMs on firm statistical foundations by relating them to a class of models that are well studied in the statistics community, yet it generalizes this class of models in an interesting way. Second, it leads to an understanding of how FHMMs can be applied to many different types of time-series data, including Bernoulli and multinomial data, not just data that are real valued. Finally, it leads to an effective learning procedure for FHMMs that is easier to understand and easier to implement than existing learning procedures. Simulation results suggest that FHMMs trained with the generalized backfitting algorithm are a practical and powerful tool for analyzing sequential data.},
